Does Ethereum Use The GHOST protocol? 

+++ <details><summary> +++
Answer 
+++ </summary><div> +++
---- 
The GHOST protocol as it was described, originally included uncle blocks to determine the longest chain. The addition of these uncle blocks means that concensus was actually arrived at by evaluating the Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree, which is what GHOST stands for. Interestingly, Ethereum abandoned GHOST early on. While uncle blocks still get a mining reward, they are not used when determining the longest chain.
